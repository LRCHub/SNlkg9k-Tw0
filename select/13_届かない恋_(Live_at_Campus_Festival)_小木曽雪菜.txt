Kodoku na furi wo shiteru no? naze darou ki ni natteita
Kizukeba itsu no manika dare yori hikareteita

Are you pretending to be lonely? Why? I'm curious about it
Before I even realised it, I was completely charmed by you

Dou sureba kono kokoro wa kagami ni utsuru no?

What should I do to have my heart reflected in the mirror?

Todokanai koi wo shiteite mo utsushidasu hi ga kuru kana
Boyaketa kotae ga mie hajimeru made wa
Ima mo kono koi wa ugokidasenai

Even though my love is unreachable,
I wonder if the day it is reflected will come
Until I can start to see that blurred answer
My heart cannot come alive

Hajimete koe wo kaketara furimuite kureta ano hi
Anata wa mabushi sugite massugu mirenakatta

That day when I first called out to
You and you turned around to face me
You were so dazzling that I couldn't look straight at you

Dou sureba sono kokoro ni watashi wo utsusu no?

What should I do to have myself reflected in your heart?

Kanawanai koi wo shiteite mo utsushidasu hi ga kuru kana
Boyaketa kotae ga sukoshi demo mietara
Kitto kono koi wa ugoki hajimeru

Even though my love won't come true,
I wonder if the day it is reflected will come
If I can see that blurred answer, even a little
Then my love will surely start to stir

Dou sureba kono kokoro wa kagami ni utsuru no?

What should I do to have my heart reflected in the mirror?

Todokanai koi wo shiteite mo utsushidasu hi ga kuru kana
Boyaketa kotae ga mie hajimeru made wa
Ima mo kono koi wa ugokidasenai
